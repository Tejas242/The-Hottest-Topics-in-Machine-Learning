# NIPS Research Papers Analysis Project

Welcome to the NIPS Research Papers Analysis Project! This project involves analyzing a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to uncover the latest trends in machine learning. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be valuable for working with other text datasets as well.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Analyze NIPS research papers to discover trends in machine learning.
- **Tools Used:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Natural Language Processing.
- **Project Type:** Data analysis and Natural Language Processing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Tejas242/The-Hottest-Topics-in-Machine-Learning
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`nips_analysis.ipynb`) using Jupyter or any compatible environment.

## Project Structure

- `datasets/`: Folder containing the NIPS research paper datasets.
- `nips_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the main project code and analysis.
- `README.md`: You are here! This file provides an overview of the project.

## Requirements

- Python (3.x recommended)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis)

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`nips_analysis.ipynb`).
2. Follow the code and instructions in the notebook to perform the analysis.
3. Customize the analysis and visualizations to your preferences.

## Acknowledgments
